# **A Guide for Dunder-LSP operators**

If you are a LND node runner and want to commit to scaling the Lightning Network, this guide is for you.

There are three points to keep in mind: 
1) Dunder LSP works only for LND nodes at the moment
2) I am far from being a developer, so this guide is built solely on my experience setting a Dunder LSP Server up.
3) I link to guides from experienced Bitcoiners and developers I used myself. But still, do your own research.
